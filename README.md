# GeoThesis

This repository is part of my **Masterâ€™s Thesis** project, focusing on **geothermal energy potential** in **Switzerland**. The project involves data extraction, transformation, and visualization of geothermal probe data and heat demand models.

## Overview

The goal is to analyze and integrate geospatial datasets related to **geothermal boreholes** and **heat demand** to assess the feasibility of geothermal energy applications. This includes:

- **Extracting** data from official sources
- **Transforming** coordinate systems for compatibility
- **Merging** heat demand and geothermal probe datasets
- **Visualizing** spatial trends and energy potential

## Structure as of 30.01.2025

- `01_extraction_zh_waermekataster.ipynb` â€“ Extracts geothermal borehole data.
- `02_extraction_bfe_fernwaermenachfrage.ipynb` â€“ Extracts heat demand model data.
- `03_transformation_zh_waermekataster_and_bfe_fernwaermekataster.ipynb` â€“ Merges and processes datasets.
- `read_geothermal_probes.ipynb` â€“ Reads and analyzes the geothermal probe dataset.
- `requirements.txt` â€“ Dependencies for running the notebooks.

## Work in Progress ðŸš§

This repository is actively being developed as part of my thesis. Expect ongoing updates and refinements.
